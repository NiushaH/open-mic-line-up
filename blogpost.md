CODING IS LIKE ART


People say that art is a reflection of society.

I believe that coding and the technology developed to run machines, too, is an art.

The creativity apparent in building programming languages that link hardware with software, along with their respective libraries, and the ability to connect to tools developed for software engineering like markup and scripting languages creating multiple layers within a tech stack is much like the diversity and interconnectedness of the global community we see reflected in art museums around the world. Different teams come together to use these tools to create apps in various ways for their communities.

For example, at Flatiron School we learned to use Thin, Rack and Sinatra together as a foundation to exchange data and connect information with a SQLite database that would run on a server accessible by browsers and display information to users after running through HTML and CSS markup languages.

Much like the world of art, the full stack of an app mimics the process of the steps it takes to develop a beautiful piece of art from initial sketch to masterpiece on display. Each step from ideation to engineering to testing to product launch is integral to the success of the app and it’s user experience. Working on this project, I gained an appreciation for the cooperation of the technologies at work — whoever developed these and figured out how they work together was as brave and lifechanging as the person who discovered how to put spray paint from a can onto various surfaces! As a beginner software engineer, I can see how having a deep understanding of tools in the marketplace can profoundly improve the way in which a product or application comes together and its impact on people’s lives.

Below you will see an outline where I visually depicted how the various Sinatra project files in my Open Mic Night application are connected and work with one another.

During the time that I worked on my project, much of the world’s communities were facing COVID-19 and sheltering in place. Many turned to the arts to cope with the isolation and shut down of public spaces.

Contemplating the state of the world, I was inspired to work on building an application that would bring joy to people around the world who could use a platform to find entertainment they would enjoy producing or consuming. Thus began the creation of an open mic night sign up application… a service that one of my daughters would have loved to have at her fingertips when she began her open mic night career in her toddler years.

Initially, I began the project with the idea of independent artists who would like to practice performing in their local event venues. This is a bare bones application that allows for a user to sign up to use the application, authenticates their credentials, establishes a session whereby they can create, read, update, and delete the song(s) they wish to perform.

Ruby’s corneal gem was handy in setting up the application as well as to create the database tables and model classes. RESTful routes in the three controllers map the user’s view pages using HTTP verbs and allow the user to manipulate their data in the SQL tables via CRUD actions.

Ideas developed for improving this project so it would be ready to launch for market entry the longer I spent time building the application. Eventually, it would be great to create a venue user who could create open mic nights and the application would not only allow the venue user to establish a set list, but it would also confirm the performance time and curtain call for the open mic night performer.

Ideally, the Open Mic Night app could be used for anything from a karaoke performance or poetry recital to a stand up comedy routine or short dramatic skit to storytelling on stage. A stretch goal would be to allow all users to follow their favorite artists and/or event venues and be alerted to their upcoming performances as soon as they’re confirmed/announced.

All in all this was a fun application to create and begin learning HTML, CSS, and SQLite while practicing coding more in Ruby.
